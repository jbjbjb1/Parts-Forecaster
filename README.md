# Parts-Forecaster
Use historical data of parts sales to predict future sales.

## How to use
* Select (A) Select Excel File and process the data. Save it as the default file name.
* Use either of the two (B) options to select the file made with (A). It will plot the result for you to view.

## Next steps
The ETS statistical method looks to have some merrit. It needs at least 2 years of data to get annual trends

## History
Initially the code was written trying to estimate the history of each individual part. This was not yeilding accurate results and so it was attempted to just estimate based on sum of part sales. This was not great either and so this is as far as this project has got.
